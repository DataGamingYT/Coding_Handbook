// To start a java code file, you must first declare the class. Of which is shown below

public class Java_Intro{


    // You do this by declaring a public class with the same name as the file
    // The class is the blueprint of the object
    // The class is defined by a set of brackets
    // Next is the main method, which is the entry point of the program, shown below

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        


        // This is where you write your code
        // The main mrthod is again defined by a set of brackets
        




        // This is the most basic line of code in Java
        // This line of code will print out the text "Hello, World!" to the console
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
